# JPEG to Array Converter for Arduino/ESP32
## Project Description
This project is a Python application for converting JPEG and PNG images into a data array that can be used in Arduino and ESP32 sketches. The program is specifically designed to work with the ST7789V 2.0-inch TFT display (240x320, SPI interface).

### How the Program Works
The application provides a graphical interface using the Tkinter library, where users can select an image for conversion. Once an image is chosen, itâ€™s processed and converted into an RGB565 data array compatible with the ST7789V TFT display, then saved in the image_array.txt file.

-  RGB to RGB565 Conversion: Each pixel is converted from RGB format to RGB565, a color format optimized for TFT displays. This reduces memory usage and improves display performance.
-  Supported Formats: Users can select both JPEG and PNG files.
-  Array Generation: The converted image data is saved in image_array.txt. Values are formatted as 0xFFFF, separated by commas, and aligned in rows of 16 values for easy readability.
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
Pillow (for image processing)
tkinter (for the graphical interface)
To install the Pillow dependency, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Display Example

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the program by right-clicking on the convert.py.exe.py file, selecting "Open with", and choosing Python.

2. In the graphical interface that appears, click the "Select Image" button and choose a JPEG or PNG file.

3. The program will convert the image and save the data array in image_array.txt.

4. Open image_array.txt, copy the array, and paste it into your Arduino/ESP32 sketch to display the image on your TFT screen.
 

## Installation and Running

To start the application, simply right-click on 'convert.py.exe.py' and choose "Open with Python".
